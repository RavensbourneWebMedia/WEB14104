# Projects

### Sharing is caring

This project is about using code (HTML, CSS and a dash of JavaScript) creatively to communicate and advocate a cause you care about.

All the project material is [here](projects/sharing-is-caring).

<!--
### Content needs design

On this **team project** you will learn how to design systems (*containers*) to store and display *content* that doesn't yet exist (or that someone else will produce).   

All the project material is [here](projects/).
-->

### Our space

On this **team project** you will design and build a website for our Ravensbourne Web Media degree course.

Starting from research (interviews with staff & students, competitor analysis) you will devise a content strategy and then build a technically sound, aesthetically cohesive and appropriately structured website.

<!--All the project material is [here](projects/).-->


# Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand how the **WWW** works (browsers, servers, HTTP, DNS, IP etc).
* Visualise your ideas and explore design solutions through paper and digital **wireframes**.
* Use **HTML** to structure Web content appropriately and accessibly.  
* Use **CSS** to style Web pages cohesively and coherently, being informed by contemporary trends. 
* Upload your project files to a Web server using **FTP**.
* Make Web pages dynamic using **PHP**.
* Manage online content using **WordPress**.
* Modify and maintain WordPress **templates and themes**.
* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.
* Use the Git version-control system (through GitHub) to **collaborate** with your team and **back-up** your project files.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late (even by 5 minutes) or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).

* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.

* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).

* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.

* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
