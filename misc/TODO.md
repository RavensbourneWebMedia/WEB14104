# Term 3

It's not enough to coast along and settle on the first (or second) design.

I believe that you can all do better and I want to help you improve. 

I don't want to be marking work that it's just *ok*. 

So far we've been quite gentle at you but we're going to accelerate and it's going to get harder.

You need to work harder and challenge yourselves.

You're paying a lot to be here. Imagine yourself in a few years time, looking back at what you have done (or not) at uni. 

Now it's your opportunity to experiment, to explore and soak up all the knowledge and skills from all the people that are around you here.


### Computational thinking 

Teaching computers how to play by your rules?


## Demos

* How to create a mobile-friendly navigation (with hamburger button) (see http://adventure.com)
* How to make a fixed footer (again, see http://adventure.com)

## FTP and hosting

* Doug's guide on hosting stuff on GitHub (via GitHub pages) http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015/01/04/github-pages

## JS

* [JS design patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) by Addy Osmani

## WP

From Gutenberg (printing revolution) to Zuckerberg (social media "revolution"), passing by WordPress (blogging revolution: everyone can be a publisher)

Jargon Buster: API, SPA, REST...

SPA (Single Page Application) vs page reload: Using the API has a performance benefit: static HTML pages with JS to fetch the data is a thing! No PHP dependency.

* http://www.wpbeginner.com/ any good?

WordPress is one of the best platforms out there for creating a website. It's super awesome for blogging. It's open-sourced and has tons of free plugins and themes you can play with. 
Hey, even the nuSchool blog is built with WordPress! (Also: Adobe blogs, Huffington Post, TED, CNN, TIME, UPS.....)

## Planning

This [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lMmuSlkP/public-design-sprint-template) breaks down the five phases of a design sprint. More on this [here](http://www.gv.com/lib/gimlet)

# The future

* Everyone starts from an F and can walk their way up to A
* Continuous micro-assessment, not just at the end of a unit (more **tutorials**)
* Rigorous assessment criteria, shared with everyone from the beginning
* Shared leaderboard
* Teacher as a **coach** (rather than a judge)
* Peer-assessment to offer different perspectives and opportunities to reflect
* FTP can be learned earlier on (in the first term)
* Installing WP could be done earlier on (in the first term)
* More **challenges**, both at home and in class
* Trello earlier on


### Our community

Build a site for the class, or the RaveWebMedia course.

### Build something cool

Mini-projects of 3 weeks, self-initiated. Students pitch an idea based on research they made or inspirations they found and then *build something cool* based around that idea.

* I want to learn how to ...
* I found this technique {here} and {there}
* I'm inspired by ...
* I want to make it better / mash it up with ...

From [Bento](https://www.bento.io/tour)

> It's important to pick a project
Learning to code is like learning to ride a bike. You can read a lot of things about how to turn the pedals, watch videos on how to steer, and even have someone show you how to brake. But until you actually get on a bike and try riding, you'll never learn. Coding is the same thing: it's not enough to learn using tutorials, you have to pick a project and build something as you're learning.


### Trello + Git workflow

Project management and time planning should be integral part of the unit (weekly stand-ups and tutorials).

Task management should also be integrated with the Git workflow: **complete a task > do a commit**.

What about **big files**? Need to remind people that GitHub doesn't like files bigger than 50MB. For those, you should use a CDN really. But what if you committed them by mistake? SourceTree > reset file to commit.. ?
