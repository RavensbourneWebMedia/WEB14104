# Assessment criteria

Your final mark will be based on:

* [80% project](#project)
* [20% blog](#blog)


## Project

### Components

1. **Research** [*analysis*](sessions/week-02.md#blog) of bad websites and [*mood board*](sessions/week-04.md#homework)
* **Interface design** experimentation and testing of ideas through *wireframes* at various stages, from [paper](sessions/week-05.md#sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper) to [digital](sessions/week-06.md#redraft-your-wireframes)
* **Front-end code** responsive, cohesive and appropriately structured [*HTML & CSS*](sessions/week-11.md#homework) (bonus: JavaScript); includes [recipe mini-project](sessions/week-05.md#blog)
* **Back-end code** accessible and dynamic web-pages served via [*WordPress*](sessions/week-14.md#template) (bonus: plugins) 
* **Workflow** all your project files on *GitHub* (bonus: action plan)

### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) We saw you around but you failed to show evidence of your work. 

#### E

* **Research** either analysis or moodboard are missing
* **Interface design** wireframes for only a couple of pages, using filler content (*Lorem ipsum*, no images)
* **Front-end code** it has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience  
* **Back-end code** it has major bugs or is incomplete to a point that is impossible to get a clear idea of the user experience
* **Workflow** dumped files with no clear folders structure and/or bad naming (*untitled folder* and the likes), sparse commits


#### D

* **Research** disorganised or subjective, didn't use the suggested methods
* **Interface design** wireframes for only a couple of pages, using real(istic) content  
* **Front-end code** it is functional but not responsive or appropriately structured  
* **Back-end code** it has some bugs but it is possible to get a glimpse of the user experience
* **Workflow** sparse *end-of-day-dump* commits

#### C

* **Research** demonstrates use of suggested methods but it is superficial or unfocused
* **Interface design** wireframed 50%+ of page templates, using real(istic) content  
* **Front-end code** it is appropriately structured but not responsive (or viceversa)   
* **Back-end code** it is functional (no bugs)  
* **Workflow** sparse yet meaningful commits (specific to tasks, descriptive messages) 

#### B

* **Research** demonstrates use of suggested methods, explanations are informed by examples and other evidence
* **Interface design** wireframed all page templates, using real(istic) content; demonstration of several iterations of ideas  
* **Front-end code** it is appropriately structured and responsive  
* **Back-end code** it is functional at its core, attempts to add extra features (eg: plugins)
* **Workflow** frequent and meaningful commits

#### A

* **Research** demonstrates use of suggested methods, providing lots of links and attributions of ideas, as well as visuals to illustrate concepts; extensive market research
* **Interface design** wireframed all page templates, using real(istic) content; demonstration of several iterations of ideas  with evidence of user-testing  
* **Front-end code** it is appropriately structured, responsive and progressively enhanced (JavaScript may be used but not a necessity) + comments  
* **Back-end code** it is functional at its core, successfully added extra features
* **Workflow** frequent and meaningful commits + action plan


<!--

Interface design
	needs to mention both paper and digital

Front-end code
	separate out HTML & CSS	

Back-end code
	if you're just tweaking a template, that's a missed learning opportunity
