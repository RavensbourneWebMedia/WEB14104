### It's too hard

If it hurts a little bit, that's good (think about physical exercise).

### What can I learn from this?

How can I `hack` this into something useful and even enjoyable?

I'm going to learn how to do this, and the I'll know how to do it *forever*!

### It's not your fault

We're constantly experimenting with new technologies and projects. Every person learns in a different way and every group has different dynamics. 

We really want your input in this. Let us know if something is confusing or challenging.

### You don't need to memorise everything

Instead, learn how to search online for solutions, and integrate them in your projects.

Uni is not about memorising and regurgitating facts and figures (like you were taught to do at school). It's about **problem solving**!

### Become code-literate

You will need to **understand code**, but not necessarily become a coding wizard. Similar to how you understand English and can write in English, but may not have ambitions to become a writer or playwright.

### You can do it

It may take some time. Learning any skill takes time. 

Think about someone who is "top of their field" (favourite athlete, artist etc). How long do you reckon it took them to get there? 1 week? 2 months? A year?

The good thing about uni is that you bought yourself 3 years to become good at this!

### Don't reject yourself

Don't tell yourself you can't do it, before seeing what you are capable of.

> I'll never be good 

Allow yourself to try out things. Give yourself a chance.

### Stop saying *I have to do this*

Nobody is forcing you.
