# [Week 1](../sessions/01)

Get "struggling people" close to the screen/facilitator, so they won't fall behind. Ask them to tell you if they are falling behind.

Didn't get to finish the curtain-reveal workshop, missing:

* position relative and absolute
* form styling
* gh-pages

# [Week 2](../sessions/02)

Not sure people actually did the *JS for cats* tutorial.

# [Week 3](../sessions/03)

*WWWTF* peer-learning didn't work (not many connections, people relaying unimportant facts). Could become a quiz instead. I think it's not that relevant at this point. We can move it to the second half of the unit, when people start to deal with Web servers, URL requests etc. 

Demonstrate **IP addresses** through browsersync, or something where people can "access" my computer?

# [Week 4](../sessions/04)

Many people considered the paper wireframes as throw-aways. Make sure they keep them (easiest way is to tell them they're going to be marked on them).

# [Week 5](../sessions/05)

General lack of **research** and content strategy.

- [x] Peer learning on Visual Advocacy
- [x] Get people to flesh out all their copy as a Google doc, and review that before we jump into coding. So GDoc > storyboard > build

# [Week 7](../sessions/07)

As a word, `goal` is more understandable than `motivation`.

# [Week 10](../sessions/10)

Should have included blogs in the formative hand-in checklist.

# Sharing is caring

Extremely important to take a **content-first** approach. 

People tend to jump into fancy-JS-parallax-scrolling-magic-wow-yet-complicated stuff, and forget about *What does this page actually say?* 

1. Identify your core audience, their motivations, pain points and cultural references.
* Work on the written parts of your page (aka the copy), make them interesting for your audience to read! 

	> Copy-writing is interface design.

	You can capture people with (more or less moving) images but then you need text (either written or spoken) to communicate precisely what you want to get across and encourage people to take action.
* Read your copy out loud, tweak it and edit it. Then start integrating it in your page.
* Make your page look interesting with HTML, CSS and images only. Forget JS at the  beginning.


# [Week 12](../sessions/12)

Xtensio is a really useful tool to create **personas**. Need to question people's choices in relation to the default template. 

People got slightly confused by the personas *dimensions* (behaviours, limitations etc not demographics). A good example could be: 

> We are planning to create two personas: one representing current students and one representing parents. 

> Ali is in his 40s, has 2 children, and is a current student at Ravensbourne. For the sake of our personas we won't consider Ali's age and parental status. What really matters to us is that Ali is a student, so we'll put Ali  *with* the students.

# [Week 13](../sessions/13)

Typecast kind of sucks.

It would be nice to use GridLover, but it doesn't allow you to save your projects (it seems to cache the HTML locally, but CSS edits get lost). 

# General

### Blogging

Blogging regularly: maybe pick one blog a week from a random student, to keep them on their toe.

Get all students to share their blog URL on Slack. Can't be Google Docs or anything else private.



<!--
# Session 1

* Intro: would be good to base the conversation around the **assessment criteria**, and show concrete examples of students work with marks.

* **Draw the Web** is fun, everyone apart from ON enjoyed it. Also interesting conversation afterwards, which leads well into the next research task.

* **Research** on Google Doc worked well, need to force people to reference their sources.

* Collaborative research and discussion on *How does it WWWork* went quite well.
To make it more **playful** and keep people's *antennas* up, we could introduce a *ball* (or any other soft object that can be easily and safely thrown around.. idea from Angela Morelli, Science Museum 2011). Only who has the *ball* can speak, and whenever s/he mentions a keyword that belongs to someone else, they need to pass it to them and let them talk a bit.

* [ ] Discussion around key WWW concepts: could experiment with an object that needs to be passed/thrown to the person who's in charge of a concept you mentioned. 
 

# [Session 2](../sessions/week-02.md)

### Learning goals review

Learning goals review in small groups went well I think. Maybe experiment with jotting down common goals on a whiteboard?

### Semiotics

Semiotics leading into MD: students interested but could go a bit quicker. Ask more questions.

### GitHub and MD

1. Introduce MD and GitHub: who else is using it? Make it **relevant**. Have a discussion around the benefits of a back-up + version-control system
2. Sign up to GitHub
3. Create your first repo
4. Clone rep
5. Draft a recipe in MD (without searching online, just a first draft)
6. Commit and push recipe draft
7. Demo how to do images and hyperlinks, as well as lists
8. Redraft recipe, commit and push again
9. README.md and link to recipe folder
10. GH-pages?

- [ ] MD: focus on writing rather than making it look good, or adding spaces between things?

* GitHub: more efficient to add people to a team and then add the whole team as **collaborators** in the repo

* [ ] Fork or branch? See below.

* [ ] Git: need to explain the difference between clone, fork, push and pull. Maybe with a **Git quiz**?

### Analysis

**What makes a website bad?**: try it as a group exercise. Maybe assign each group a couple of principles to concentrate on? 

* Instead of subjective statements like "I highly dislike the aesthetics" ask questions such as "How is this feature serving (or not) the business and its customers?" and "Why was this designed and built the way it is?"


# Session 3

* **Separation of concerns** seemed to go down well, mostly because of the BBC example than the royal paper dolls.

* **Quiz time** was the most successful activity of the day, in terms of students attention, as everybody participated quite actively. The quiz sparked a few interesting questions too.

* **HTML recipe**: short and focused exercise, gave me the opportunity to compare solutions and highlight good / bad practices.  

* The XML sandwich confused a couple of students. Maybe I should have asked *Is this sandwich valid HTML* as part of the quiz? 
 
* Most people seem uninterested in analysing bad websites or using heuristics (too abstract?) In general they seem to want me to teach them *how to make cool Web things*. Practical knowledge, **no theory plz**. 

* Introduced **alternative brief**: *design a website for the Ravensbourne Web Media course*. I feel that this would be an easier, more relatable subject for students to work on. Also giving them the same subject could create a common ground for ideas and maybe foster a healthy competition?

* Had to show **how Git works** again. Which is fine, need to remember that this workflow is not easy, many people don't seem to grasp how folders and files really work, or how to save files with the right extension. So it's worth demonstrating how to save an html file and commit-push it to GitHub.

* Should I have a **student alter ego** to push stuff to? 

* GTD video captured most people's attention. **Buzzwords bingo** not sure, need to experiment more with it, maybe base the discussion around the buzzwords. In general, need to get better at **moderating discussions**.  

* [Action plan](../sessions/week-03.md#assignment): we're not following it. Try something practical like Trello?

- [ ] **Keyboard tricks** eg <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>left</kbd> to select a whole line of text

# Session 4

### HTML and CSS boilerplates?

* folder structure, naming shit
* HTML comments
* CSS comments
* CSS reset / normalize
* CSS scaffolding `max-width` and `margin`

### Moodboard

Give it a checklist of components, eg:

* inspiring competitors (screenshots of entire pages)
* inspiring details (screenshots)
* colours
* imagery
* typography
* current state of affairs
* possible directions

- [ ] Do it on Pinterest, but go outside of Pinterest to add your own screenshots and real-life examples. Don't just re-pin stuff!

# Session 5

* **Folder structure** and how to `<link` files. Don't take it for granted. Can be part of the quiz

* [] Check [PhotoshopEtiquette](http://photoshopetiquette.com/) out

* [] Check [Rana's recipe evolution](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/Blogging/Week%205%20(Evolution%20of%20recipe)/Markdown-evoloution%20of%20recipe.md) out

### Grids

* Show **examples** from [960GS](http://960.gs) to demonstrate how grid systems are used by real websites.. and also big sites like The Guardian, Time etc.

* Show badly aligned code and **well indented code**, to demonstrate how grids are useful to make information easy to read / scan

* **LDN vs NYC** map: which one is easier to navigate?

* Maybe GridLover should be done on the previous session, before people start writing their recipe's CSS?

### Recipe demo

> In-greedy-ants

Used Skeleton to quickly demo how to lay out a recipe using a grid. [Here's the code](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/tree/master/sessions/skeleton-recipe).

I think it makes sense to do a live-demo for people to follow along and ask questions.

Maybe have some content ready, like a list of ingredients to plonk in as a `<ul>` and the method.  

### Policing

* Low **turnout**, again. What can we do about it?

* People getting **distracted by phones**.. should we start confiscating them? 

### Writing

* People struggle to **articulate** their ideas.. they say things like *I want to make this site look better* or *I want to make this look more basic and easier to navigate*. See [this example](https://github.com/RanaKarim/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Rana/Moodboard.jpg). 

* People don't **edit** what they write. See [this example](https://github.com/jackkemmish/WEB14104/blob/master/students/Jack/Bad%20Websites/the_bad_website%20chosen%20one.md). There are sweeping **assumptions** like *it can be made more interesting by adding a better structure to the lay out* (what structure? how better? what is the lay out?)

- [ ] Maybe show some stream of consciusness stuff.. some badly written text and ask them to re-write it?


# Session 6

### Wireframes critique

It went well, people really engaged with it. 

`+` give people post-its to write comments on
`+` hang wireframes on the wall and stand around them

- [x] Useful for the first session to be all around the same project and crit one project at a time. In future sessions we could try and do it more informally.

- [x] Should have showed **bad examples** of wireframes before, such as empty boxes and lorem ipsum.

Banned words

* dynamic
* Oswald font
* yellow background

- [x] Critiquette before leading questions


# Session 9

### Formative presentations issues

* How to give consistent feedback? Some sort of form to fill in and hand out with the same fields..
* *Peer assessment* To keep people engaged and listening to each other's presentations. Spreadsheet / matrix where everyone can give feedback to each other.. simple structure could be + (to be inspired) / - (to improve or change)
- [x] Tried with [this](https://bit.ly/WEB14104formative)
* How to make it less miserable for myself?
* Practicing and rehearsing
* Sticking to given time
* Having your materials ready (all the files, don't faff around with code, opening/closing folders)
* First slide should be a summary of your presentation: I'm going to start from A, then talk about B, then move on to C, and ask you D
* Make your presentation <del>interactive</del>interesting: ask questions to your audience, tell a story, be excited (see http://speaking.io?)


# Session 10

Codio experiment didn't go well: it doesn't offer a live preview, and what's more frustrating it sometimes stops auto-saving.

# Session 14

### FB quiz went well

Quiz questions probably too easy (could go faster) but the group chat experiment worked, at least it got participation up. 

Some serious `multitaskers` (or simply they can't focus for more than 30 seconds on anything) in the room, still need to keep them on their toes by calling out their names and asking them questions

### Plugins

People liked the beetle analogy.

Should get them to install a couple of plugins before ACF

ACF and Repeater: how to make a case for it? Maybe couple of examples of unstructured page vs tidy form

Should have showed them a couple of field groups (recipe + one lucky grabber)

### Themes

Should make a **super-simple ultra-barebones** theme (codename `PressWord`) and show people how to import their wireframes and start converting them.

Theme would include `skeleton` and `bootstrap`, as well as the function `consoleLog`

> HTML island in a PHP ocean :)

Shouldn't have asked them to download a new theme, but we all start from the same.

### Homework

Create custom fields appropriate to your website

Start moving your HTML wireframes into WP (give a couple of pointers, eg header/content/footer)


# Session 18

### Fonts? 

Maybe we should have a session specifically on typography and get people to experiment with fonts.

- [ ] Typecast exercise (you'll be marked on that): make something look good (and informative) without using images

- [ ] Is there a site that has some sort of **word-cloud** of associations with fonts, eg: `Comic Sans` > *unprofessional*, *childish* but perhaps also *fun*
 
### CTA (aka the thing)

What's the call to action of every page?  
  
![](http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Keynote-11-700x523.png)





# General

* Start thinking about **how long** each part of the day may take

* Split workshops in two halves:

	1. Everybody does the same thing: same apps (eg MAMP), same tech (eg: WP theme and plugins) and same content (eg: recipe)
	2. We let *fast learners* experiment and troubleshoot with the others 




# Github: branching or forking?

### Branching

`+` You can comment on code lines (in commit pages)

`+` Students contributions will show up immediately in the [contributors](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/graphs/contributors) page

`+` Students MUST accept 

### Forking

`+` Repo will show up on the user's dashboard

`+` You can [visualise commits](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/network)



# Briefs

### From `redesign a bad website` to `uglify a good website`? 

See [this essay](http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/13/3/314.full.pdf+html) 

> Internet Ugly is an imposition of messy humanity upon an online world of smooth gradients, blemish-correcting Photoshop, and AutoCorrect. It exploits tools meant to smooth and beautify, using them to muss and distort. 

### Do cool stuff
