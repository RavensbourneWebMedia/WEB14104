# Brief

Design and build a portfolio website for a professional of your choice (not yourself).

Your website must 

* be **online** (not just on your computer)
* be **dynamic** (update-able via a CMS) 
* be **responsive** (adapting to different screen sizes)
* be **accessible** (for people with disabilities and limited devices)
* be visually **cohesive** and coherent
* have **appropriately structured** information
* have a style informed by (but not necessarily following) contemporary trends

### Components

1. **Research** [competitor analysis](#competitor-analysis) and [mood board](../sessions/week-04.md#homework)
* **Interface design** experimentation and testing of ideas through *wireframes* at various stages, from [paper](../sessions/week-05.md#sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper) to [digital](../sessions/week-06.md#redraft-your-wireframes)
* **Front-end code** responsive, cohesive and appropriately structured [HTML & CSS](../sessions/week-11.md#homework) (bonus: JavaScript)
* **Back-end code** accessible and dynamic web-pages served via [WordPress](../sessions/week-14.md#template) (bonus: plugins) 
* **Workflow** all your project files on *GitHub* (bonus: action plan)


### Competitor analysis

Analyse at least 3 competitors, using the analysis template below.

#### Audience

Write your observations about the competitorsâ€™ **audience**(s).

Who is this website for, primarily and secondarily?

Compare them and highlight where yours will fit between them.

#### Structure

*   Welcome/about blurb: above or below _the fold_? Think responsive (ie: desktop/laptop/table/mobile)
*   Contact info: above or below _the fold_? Think responsive (ie: desktop/laptop/table/mobile)
*   Contact form: y/n (if y, how prominent), separate page or a discrete box?
*   Search: y/n (if y, how prominent)
*   About: y/n (if y, how prominent), separate page or a discrete box?
*   Portfolio: separate page for each project or all projects in one?
*   Clients: y/n (if y, how prominent), separate page or a discrete box?
*   Services: y/n (if y, how prominent), separate page or a discrete box?
*   Anything you would improve?

#### Content

*   Tone: formal - informal, shout - whisper, plain - technical, sophisticated - unpretentious, active - passive
*   Person: _I, we, you, impersonal_
*   [Calls to action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)) (eg: _Buy this_, _Follow me_ etc, usually found in buttons): what is the website asking you to do? Show examples
*   About: what kind of information, what level of detail, pictures (y/n)
*   Clients: list - case studies, pictures (y/n)
*   Services: part of a general "About" section/page or clearly separate, level of detail, does it talk about the process/workflow
*   Portfolio: what information is displayed for each project (short description vs case study, testimonials, slideshows of screenshots, drafts and sketches)? How is it categorised?
*   Workflow: how do you explain to potential customers how their process works and what expectations both parties should have?
*   Contact: form or not? What kind of contact details (email, phone, Twitter etc)
*   Anything you reckon is missing?

#### Layout

*   Colour palette: light (neutral), dark (contrasted/bold)
*   Grid layout: 1-4columns, out-of-the-box
*   Body alignment: left, centre or right
*   Navigation alignment: top, left, bottom, right, somewhere else?
*   Navigation: vertical, horizontal
*   Portfolio: how is it laid out? What elements are more prominent?
