# Our space

On this **team project** you will design and build a website for our Ravensbourne Web Media course.

Starting from research (interviews with staff & students, competitor analysis) you will devise a content strategy and then build a technically sound, aesthetically cohesive and appropriately structured website.
<!--
* Research: interview staff & students (also potential)
* Competitor analysis with graphs: how do other courses create their own narrative on the Web?
* Content strategy (sitemap + copywriting)
* Competition (students vote) + staff jury: one site becomes the WebMedia site for a year!
-->
Your site must 

* be **online** (not just on your computer)
* be **dynamic** (update-able via a CMS) 
* be **responsive** (adapting to different screen sizes)
* be **accessible** (for people with disabilities and limited devices)
* be visually **cohesive** and coherent
* have **appropriately structured** information
* have a style informed by (but not necessarily following) contemporary trends
