# Our space

On this **team project** you will design and build a website for our Ravensbourne Web Media degree course.

You will start from **research**: user interviews and competitor analysis. You will then define a **content strategy** and iterate your design ideas through **wireframes**. Finally, you will implement your designs into a **WordPress**-based website.

<!-- build a technically sound, aesthetically cohesive and appropriately structured website. -->

<!--
* Research: interview staff & students (also potential)
* Competitor analysis with graphs: how do other courses create their own narrative on the Web?
* Content strategy (sitemap + copywriting)
* Competition (students vote) + staff jury: one site becomes the WebMedia site for a year!
-->

Your website must 

* provide **useful and usable** information to your target audience
* speak the language of your target audience (aka *language mirror*)
* be visually **cohesive**
* be informed by (but not necessarily following) contemporary Web design trends
* be **dynamic**, meaning update-able via a CMS (WordPress)
* have a **responsive** layout, which adapts to different screen sizes
* be **accessible** for people with disabilities and limited devices
* be **online** (not just on your computer), *obviously* :)
