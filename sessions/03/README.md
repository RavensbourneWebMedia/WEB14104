# Peer-learning

### How does it WWWork?

We can think of the WWW as a **Web of interlinked knowledge** in constant evolution.

To put this concept into practice, let's pretend that each one of us is a `node` in a `network` of knowledge. Each node will hold information about a certain concept related to the WWW.

# Project

### Sharing is caring

This project is about using code (HTML, CSS and a dash of JavaScript) creatively to communicate and advocate a cause you care about.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/sharing-is-caring).

In small groups, review your concepts and storyboards:

1. What is your ***call to action***?
* What **story** does your page tell?  
* How can you **visualise information** make a stronger argument? Refer to [Visualising information for advocacy](http://visualisingadvocacy.org/).
* How can you **translate your idea into code**? Re-using code from our workshops and/or code you found online (for instance on [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/category/tutorials/) or [CodePen](http://codepen.io/)).
