### How does it WWWork?

1. The latest version of HTML is `HTML6` 

	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* EVERY HTML **element** has an opening **tag** (eg: `<a href="http://example.com">`) and a closing **tag** (eg: `</a>`)

	```html
	<a href="http://example.com"> Click me! </a>   
	```
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* All **attributes** for an HTML elements MUST go both in the opening and closing tags
	
	```html
	<a href="http://example.com"> Click me! </a id="no-spaces-in-between"> 
	```
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
*  In an HTML document every `id` **attribute** MUST be unique
	
	```html
    <p id="main-content">...</p>
    <div id="main-content">...</div>
    ```
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* An HTML **element** can have more than one `class`
	
	```html
	<p class="highlight question">...</p>
	```
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* A valid HTML document MUST have a `head` and a `body` elements wrapped in a `html` element
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* Where is best to put styling instructions? 

	- [ ] `<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your-style.css">`
	- [ ] `<p style="color:red;">This bloody text</p>`
* Every CSS file has to end in `.css`
	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false
* What's wrong with the following CSS line? 

	```css
   <p> { color: red; }
   ```     
* What's wrong with the following CSS line? 

	```css
  	p { colour: red; }      
	```
* What's wrong with the following CSS line? 

	```css
    p { color red; }  
   ```     
* These two CSS declarations achieve the same effect       
  
  	```css             
	p { color: red; }  
	 
	p 
	{ 
	 	color: red; 
	}
	```	
   	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false     
* The `#` symbol is a shortcut for

	- [ ] `class`
	- [ ] `element`
	- [ ] `id`
* A CSS declaration must be terminated by 

	- [ ]  `.` period
	- [ ]  `!` exclamation mark
	- [ ]  `;` semi-colon
	- [ ]  `:` colon	
* `style1.css` is parsed before `style2.css` [ true / false ]
	
	```html
	<head>
    	<link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet">
    	<link href="style2.css" rel="stylesheet">
	</head> 
	```		
	 	
	- [ ] true 
	- [ ] false

### Wireframes

#### Is *this* a wireframe?

Just like a map is an abstraction of a place that helps us describe its location and geography, **wireframes are abstractions** of the **structure** of an interactive system and the **relationships** between its components.

#### Wireframes are about **communicating your ideas**.

####  They are about **content**, **context** and **interaction**. 

* Use **real content**, not *lorem ipsum*. 
	
* **Words** are key. [Interface design is copywriting](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php)
	
* Think about **button labels**, how do you label user actions: is it `Share` or `Post` or `Publish` or `Say it!` or `Broadcast` for instance?  

#### They're **NOT about style**. 

When wireframing, don't worry about *colours*, *graphics* and *typography*.

### Your turn

Wireframe your one-pager idea for [Sharing is caring](../../projects/sharing-is-caring) using these paper templates from [InterfaceSketch](http://www.interfacesketch.com).

* The goal is to get your idea down on paper, but not get too caught up in the details. 

* This is to help **visualise** your ideas and **get feedback** from others. 

* The quality of your drawings and handwriting doesn't matter. No need to use rulers either. *There is no such thing as a bad drawing*. 


# Critique

1. Hang your drafts on the wall
* Grab a pen and some post-its 
* Let's *critique* each other's drafts

![](assets/wireframes-critique.jpg)

### Critiquette

All comments must be `KASH`:

* **Kind** 
	
	Focus on the work. No sarcasm or personal comments. 
	
	Your comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that your feedback is work-oriented and happy to receive it.
	
* **Actionable**	
	
	Your comments should include **suggestions** or **instructions**, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.
	
* **Specific** 

	Don't just state `It's (not) good` or `I (don't) like it`. Explain why.
	
	Comment on specific aspects or details of the work, eg: `Navigation labels are unconventional but I wonder if most people would get what they stand for..`
	
* **Helpful** 

	If it doesn't benefit the work, its creator or the class, don't share it.

In a nutshell:
 
> Be hard on content and soft on people!
