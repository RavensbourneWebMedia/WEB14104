# Formative presentations

Here's the [collaborative feedback Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxj4AHNP5-PeccuBIsz9EtTgHjW5IzE0ESYqxXMWjws/edit?usp=sharing).

### WTF should I present?

Your progress on *Sharing is caring* so far:

1. What is the **cause** your are working on? What are some reasons people are not talking about or acting on your chosen cause?* Who is your **target audience**?  
* What is the first key **reaction** you want your audience to have? 
* What is your ***call to action***? In other words, what do you want people to *do* once they have experienced your page? * What contexts, **symbols** or situations can be used to represent your issue **visually**?* How can your page open up **debate, controversy or curiosity** rather than reinforcing a single answer or perspective?
* What **story** does your page tell?  
* How are you **translating your ideas into code**?

### How long should my presentation be?

Ideally **5 minutes** (max 10 minutes) with another 5 for Q&A.

### Tips for the presenter

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

### Tips for everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't you make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button? It could be confused with an error message.`, which is much more effective, and also testable.

### Sharing is caring 

Review the feedback you received from us today and continue working on it. Remember, the final deadline for this (together with other, bigger projects) is the 10th of June but we'll check on your progress on this every month. 

### Install WordPress *locally*!

Google how to do it and then follow the instructions to install WordPress on your local Web server.

### Blog

Compare these two *infographic stories* by Angela Morelli (who will be our Skype-guest later in this unit):

1. [Food is for eating](http://www.foodisforeating.org)
* [Virtual Water](http://www.angelamorelli.com/water)

Consider them both from an **information design** and a **Web development** point of view and write about:

* target audience(s)
* aims (eg: is it to raise awareness or change behaviours?)
* calls to action
* storytelling: what are the ingredients of these stories (eg: time or place markers, more or less unexpected events, more or less direct references to your own daily experiences)?
* data visualisation (what information should be remembered?)
* technical issues (how would you improve them?)
