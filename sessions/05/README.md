# Formative presentations

Here's the [collaborative feedback Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uxj4AHNP5-PeccuBIsz9EtTgHjW5IzE0ESYqxXMWjws/edit?usp=sharing).

### WTF should I present?

Your progress on *Sharing is caring* so far:

1. What is the **cause** your are working on? What are some reasons people are not talking about or acting on your chosen cause?* Who is your **target audience**?  
* What is the first key **reaction** you want your audience to have? 
* What is your ***call to action***? In other words, what do you want people to *do* once they have experienced your page? * What contexts, **symbols** or situations can be used to represent your issue **visually**?* How can your page open up **debate, controversy or curiosity** rather than reinforcing a single answer or perspective?
* What **story** does your page tell?  
* How are you **translating your ideas into code**?

### How long should my presentation be?

Ideally **5 minutes** (max 10 minutes) with another 5 for Q&A.

### Tips for the presenter

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

### Tips for everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't you make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button? It could be confused with an error message.`, which is much more effective, and also testable.
