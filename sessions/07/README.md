# Week 7

### Today, Wednesday 17th February 2016

1. [Content first](lets-talk-about-content)
* [Workshop](#workshop): copy-writing is interface design 

Change of plan, we'll keep working on *Sharing is caring* until the Easter break.

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# Let's talk about *content*

When it comes to *content* you may hear designers (including myself) saying things like

> ... the client can do it

or 

> ... the users will *generate* it

And yet, people (the vast majority of people) come to our websites **hungry for content**.

They don't care about our *parallax scrolling*, *animated SVG*, *jQuery plugins* or whatever is trendy among us. 

They want to **find** information and **do** something with it. 

#### Usable & useful content

This is not to say that we should bin all the subtle details that can make a site delightful to use, but rather that we should start talking about the *elephant in the room*.

## What is content then?

### Content is not *Lorem Ipsum*

`Lorem Ipsum` is gibberish that conveniently fills the available space like an expanding gas. 

It is **meaningless** and **lacks context**, revealing nothing about the relationship between your design and your content.

By using `Lorem Ipsum` you are running the risk of actual, final content breaking your carefully pixel-pushed layout. What if real title are a bit longer than the conveniently cut `Lorem Ipsum` you filled your layout with? What if your client wants to have 3 paragraphs instead of 2?

#### Using *Lorem Ipsum* is a missed opportunity to do good design.

In this course `Lorem Ipsum` is banned. I warned you.

### Stock images are the visual equivalent of *Lorem Ipsum*

![](assets/stock.jpg)

Using stock images is a missed opportunity to engage with **real content**.

Instead of using a beautifully irrelevant stock image, use an ugly yet relevant one. Make it clear that it's a placeholder. 

Bad images can be useful to trigger a conversation and call for good content. As the [McDonald's theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d) states: *people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones*.

### A quick experiment

1. Think about a website you visit/use regularly. 
2. Now imagine it **without text**. 
3. What would be left?

<!--

* empty boxes
* meaningless, decontextualised images

-->

### Content is mostly **text**

Text carries [95%](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period) of your page's **meaning**, and gives **context** to your media (images, videos etc.)

You can capture people with (more or less moving) images but then you need text to:

* **communicate** precisely the message(s) you want to get across 
* **persuade** people to take action


# Workshop

If all we said so far holds true, then as Web designers we should adopt a **content-first** approach. Start with content, and design our sites/apps/products etc around it.

Let's work on what your page actually *says*, aka **copywriting**.

### Copywriting is interface design

As [they say](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php)

> Do you label a button *Submit* or *Save* or *Update* or *New* or *Create*? That's copywriting.

> Icons with names, form fields with examples, buttons with labels, step by step instructions in a process, a clear explanation of your refund policy. These are all interface design.

By the way, [*copywriting*](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copywriting) is not the same as [*copyright*](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copyright).

### Your turn

1. Open [this GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iS5VeEjtzpjkFraSJ0O80NnmLQaBZIo_FNztTVoONUM/edit?usp=sharing) and `File` > `Make a copy...`
* Rename your copy by adding your first name at the beginning, eg `Billie - Content strategy`.
* Change the sharing settings for your document so that `Anyone with the link can comment`.

	![](assets/gdoc-sharing.jpg)
* Share the link to your document with us on Slack. 
* Write about your page **target audience(s)**, their motivations, pain points, goals and language. 
* With your audience(s) in mind, **flesh out** all the copy of your page.
* We'll **test** your first draft (read out loud) between us.
* **Edit** your draft: remove the bits that are not so important, and tweak the other bits to sound like what your audience(s) may want to read.

Here's an [example content strategy document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyaSoEvu0MraH7cqeEKLMbTc1cAP-B184tB6Usx5UsM/edit?usp=sharing) I co-wrote *before* designing a [one-pager](https://codeyourapp.club) for a coding course I run.

Taking a **content-first** approach for that project has been extremely useful, allowing us to clearly identify **who** we were writing for. With the **who** in mind, planning the content and designing the site became much easier. And it lead to a very successful recruitment drive: +285% booking!


# Homework

### Sharing is caring

Continuing with the **content-first** approach, let's make your page work without JS. 

1. Keep tweaking your page **copy** on the GDoc. Read it out loud, re-write the bits that don't flow and repeat :repeat:
* Start integrating the copy in your **HTML**.
* Style your copy with **CSS**. You can use this [checklist](http://www.merttol.com/articles/web/checklist-for-better-web-typography.html) to make your copy more readable and visually appealing.
* Add images that complement your copy. They can be *placeholders* for now. Remember, an ugly relevant image is better than a beautifully irrelevant stock picture.

### Peer-learning research 

Read the chapter **Get the idea: capturing attention** (pages 46 - 70) from [Visualising Information for Advocacy](http://visualisingadvocacy.org/getbook) (free download), which explains several techniques to capture people's attention.

Each team will **focus on one technique**. 

1. Explain how that technique works and **why**. 
* Show a few **examples** of that technique in action. Not limited to the examples from the book, you can find examples of your technique in adverts, TV, magazines, social media etc. 
* Prepare a few **questions** for the rest of the class to make your mini-lesson interactive and memorable. For instance, you can ask people if they agree/disagree with a statement, or you could ask them to guess a fact/figure before you reveal the answer...

### Blog

1. Read [Copywriting is Interface Design](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php). 
* Choose a webpage (it can be one you designed / built), pick at least **5 interface elements** from that page and **analyse their copy** answering questions such as: 
	
	* Who is this interface element for?
	* When do they see this? What are they feeling at that point?
	* What do users need to know (in the context of this interface element)?
	* What must they do now, if anything? 
	* Is this interface copy effective? Why? 
	* Is it consistent with the rest of the page? Should it be? 
	* How else could it be written?
