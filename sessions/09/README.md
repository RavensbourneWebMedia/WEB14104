# Week 9

### Today, Friday 4th March 2016

1. [Tutorials](#tutorials) on *Sharing is caring*, with Tor Njamo (Web Media graduate and president of RaveSU)
* [Collective brainstorm](#our-space) on your next project: *Our space* 

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# Tutorials

Let's chat about your **brain-catching ideas** and **content strategy**.

We don't want to hear about coding issues until we have worked out your *content strategy*.

Let's not worry about how feasible / hard to build your ideas are at this point. Everything is *figureoutable*.


# Our space

On this **team project** you will design and build a website for our Ravensbourne Web Media degree.

You will start from **research**: user interviews and competitor analysis. You will then define a **content strategy** and iterate your design ideas through **wireframes**. Finally, you will implement your designs into a **WordPress**-based website.

At the beginning of June, Web Media students and staff will **vote one of your sites** as the *official* site to represent our degree for the next year!

### Research

#### Do we need research?

Think of a project you worked on. What role did research play in it? Was it good research?

#### What does research mean to you?

Research boils down to spending (a lot of) time observing people and talking to them, to find out:

* **What** are they currently doing?
* **How** are they doing something?
* What **problems** and **challenges** do they face?
* What do they **want**?
* What do they **think** they want?
* What do **we** think they want?

We use user research **insight** to inform design and improve development.

#### Two types of research

##### Qualitative research

Qualitative research is useful to answer **why** type of questions.

> Questions, answers, insights and explanations are limited by a researcher’s understanding of users’ behaviours. The only way to increase that understanding is by actually interacting with and investigating behaviours, beliefs, and assumptions outside of our own behaviours, beliefs, and assumptions. 

*From [Bill Selman, User Research Lead at Mozilla](http://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/10/why-do-we-conduct-qualitative-user-research/)*

##### Quantitative research

Useful to answer **what** and **how** (how much, how often..) types of questions.

Observe and **measure**.

**Surveys** and **analytics** are (mostly) quantitative methods.

#### Your turn

Together we will create a survey using [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com), which you can start using from today!

* What questions can we ask people?
* Which questions are more important than others (we can't ask people to give us more than 5 minutes of their time)?
* How can we make our questions not leading? 


# Homework

### *Sharing is caring* formative

1. Make a **video-presentation** (3 minutes max) of your *Sharing is caring* project.

	Focus on:
	
	* **Audience** Who is your site/campaign for?
	* **Context** What are your audience's *goals* and *pain points*? Where do we find these people? 
	* **Content** What do they want to know about your cause?
	* **Language** How do you communicate your cause to them? What visual persuasion techniques will you use? Specifically, what *words* or *sentences* resonate with your audience?
* Upload your video-presentation to YouTube or Vimeo.
* Create a `Name-Surname-WEB14105.md` MarkDown document (where `Name` is your own name and `Surname` is your own surname, like `Matteo-Menapace-WEB14105.md`).

	In that document, add the following:
	
	* **Video-presentation** link, YouTube or Vimeo, make sure I don't need permissions to view it
	* **Content strategy** GDoc, see [week 7](../07#your-turn) and make sure I don't need permissions to comment on it
	* **Research** GDoc, see [homework from week 5](../05#sharing-is-caring-1) and make sure I don't need permissions to comment on it
	* Link to your project **code on GitHub**
	* BONUS: link to your project published on **GitHub Pages**, remember `gh-pages` from [week 2](../02#publishing-on-github-pages)?
* Upload your `Name-Surname-WEB14105.md` to Moodle.

### Blog

Read and blog about this article: [Interviewing humans](https://medium.com/research-things/interviewing-humans-fa198f809c40). 

Have you interviewed anyone before?   
  
If **yes**: 

* What worked? 
* What could have been better?
* Anything that surprised you?
* What did you do with the data collected during your interview(s)?
