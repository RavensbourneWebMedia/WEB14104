# Homework

### *Sharing is caring* formative

1. Make a **video-presentation** (3 minutes max) of your *Sharing is caring* project.

	Focus on:
	
	* **Audience** Who is your site/campaign for?
	* **Context** What are your audience's *goals* and *pain points*? Where do we find these people? 
	* **Content** What do they want to know about your cause?
	* **Language** How do you communicate your cause to them? What visual persuasion techniques will you use? Specifically, what *words* or *sentences* resonate with your audience?
* Upload your video-presentation to YouTube or Vimeo.
* Create a `Name-Surname-WEB14105.md` MarkDown document (where `Name` is your own name and `Surname` is your own surname, like `Matteo-Menapace-WEB14105.md`).

	In that document, add the following links:
	
	* **Video-presentation** (YouTube or Vimeo, make sure I don't need permissions to view it)
	* **Content strategy** GDoc (see week 7, make sure I don't need permissions to comment on it)
	* **Research** links (see homework from week XYZ, make sure I don't need permissions to comment on it)  
	* Link to your project **code on GitHub**
	* BONUS: link to your project published on **GitHub pages** (remember `gh-pages` from Week 2?)
