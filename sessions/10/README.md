# Homework

### Install MAMP

Download and install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads) (the free version, not the PRO).

MAMP is an app that allows you to run a **Web server** on your computer, so that you can develop websites *locally*. 

You'll need MAMP to develop and test WordPress websites on your computer.

### Install WordPress *locally*!

Google how to do it and then follow the instructions to install WordPress on your local Web server.
