# Homework

### Our space

On this **team project** you will design and build a WordPress-based website for our Ravensbourne Web Media degree.

**Create teams here**

Over the Easter break:

1. Meet with your groups 
* Interview at least 3 current or potential Web Media students (see [guidelines below](#interview-guidelines)), then [blog](#blog) about what you found out.

#### Interview guidelines

You can start from [this GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8A0TZbtmoiquCYKq_8AYsi-tlJmlJLCnCW0GreNShU), where we jotted down some initial thoughts and possible questions to ask in face2face interviews or via online forms.

1. **Plan**: prepare a discussion guide, know what information you want to get our of the interview.
* Prepare a **guide, not a script**: let the conversation flow, and steer it gently.
* **Test** your interview (with family and friends).
* Go to **their place**, in a space where they're comfortable, best if the space where they use the product(s) you want to test / talk about. Let them show you around.
* Easier if you interview **pairs** of users: they'll be less anxious.
* **Listen**. Don't talk about yourself.
* Be comfortable with **silence**: give people time and space to answer your question.
* Be ready to **be challenged** and improvise.
* Ask the **how** (they do stuff) and **why** (they do stuff) questions.

	**Use examples** to help people understand the type of answer you are after.
	
	**Help participants tell their stories**, what happened before and after. And what would have happened if...

* Avoid **leading questions**. Try not to bias your interviewees.

	bad > `How much do you love using XYZ?`
	
	good > `Tell me about your most recent XYZ experience` (more concrete & memorable)
* Avoid **closed questions**.

	bad > `Do you order A, B or C?`
	
	good > `How do you choose food when going out?`
* Try **casual requests** instead of questions. For instance, instead of asking `How do you store your photos?` consider asking them to show you how they store photos.	
* You're interested in them as people, not just as users
* Be respectful
* Smile :smile:

You can conduct the interview via Skype/FaceTime.

### Install MAMP

Download and install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads) (the free version, not the PRO).

MAMP is an app that allows you to run a **Web server** on your computer, so that you can develop websites *locally*. 

You'll need MAMP to develop and test WordPress websites on your computer.

### Install WordPress *locally*!

Google how to do it and then follow the instructions to install WordPress on your local Web server.

### Blog

*Individually*: jot down the **5 key points** for each interview as early as possible, whilst they're all still fresh in your memory. 

Then *with your team*: write a **summary** of your interviews, in which you highlight **emerging patterns** (e.g. more than one interviewee pointing out the same issue).
