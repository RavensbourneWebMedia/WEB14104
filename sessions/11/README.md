# In the previous episodes

Content is king (and queen, and drag queen), 

Understanding audiences is key

Content-first approach (learning from mistakes, when you dive into code and then realise that your content sucks...)

### Regarding your formative hand-ins...

Emerging themes and a few pointers:

* `Untitled.md` is not a sensible file name. A `.pdf` is not a `.md` document.

	Bear in mind that in some jobs / competitions your application would be automatically disqualified if you don't follow the *rules*. 
	
	You may complain that certain rules are arbitrary, and that stressing over them is pedantic or a waste of time, however it's important you get used to it now, rather than learning the hard way later.
	
	Also, noticing these small details and *conventions* will hugely help you become a **better coder**.

* Linking to stuff that is only on your computer won't work, e.g. `file:///Users/Afsara/Downloads/week-3-package/index.html`

	You need to **put your work online**. Best way is GitHub. [Remember GitHub and SourceTree](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Web-Design-principles/tree/2015/sessions/01#everybody)?

* When you write about something, *anything*, always think about your **readers**. 

	Are they aware of what you're writing about? Do they know enough about your topic to understand what you are writing about? How do you know? Are you assuming they know? 

	The best way to find out is **asking someone to read what you wrote**. If anything is not clear to them, there's a good chance many more people will find that unclear. 
	
	With practice, you'll become better at *spotting your own assumptions* and make your writing clearer. However, having someone else proof-read your work is always a winner (every writer does it, no matter how experienced they are).

### Rules of the road

* Blogging regularly
* peer learning
* perusing the library
* GitHub (bounties?)
* if you can't present during assessment you'll make YouTube videos

### Let's talk about being professional

# Interviewing humans

In teams, discuss and prepare an interview script for your core audience.

#### Interview guidelines

You can start from [this GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FP5CgvRyOCmCam_WfOAabZz4VP9BMOy0nw6-GXZwopM/edit?usp=sharing), where we jotted down some initial thoughts and possible questions to ask in face2face interviews or via online forms.

1. **Plan**: prepare a discussion guide, know what information you want to get our of the interview.
* Prepare a **guide, not a script**: let the conversation flow, and steer it gently.
* **Test** your interview (with family and friends).
* Go to **their place**, in a space where they're comfortable, best if the space where they use the product(s) you want to test / talk about. Let them show you around.
* Easier if you interview **pairs** of users: they'll be less anxious.
* **Listen**. Don't talk about yourself.
* Be comfortable with **silence**: give people time and space to answer your question.
* Be ready to **be challenged** and improvise.
* Ask the **how** (they do stuff) and **why** (they do stuff) questions.

	**Use examples** to help people understand the type of answer you are after.
	
	**Help participants tell their stories**, what happened before and after. And what would have happened if...

* Avoid **leading questions**. Try not to bias your interviewees.

	bad > `How much do you love using XYZ?`
	
	good > `Tell me about your most recent XYZ experience` (more concrete & memorable)
* Avoid **closed questions**.

	bad > `Do you order A, B or C?`
	
	good > `How do you choose food when going out?`
* Try **casual requests** instead of questions. For instance, instead of asking `How do you store your photos?` consider asking them to show you how they store photos.	
* You're interested in them as people, not just as users
* Be respectful
* Smile :smile:

You can conduct the interview via Skype/FaceTime.


# Homework

### Quantitative research

Prepare a [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) questionnaire and start collecting results.

### Qualitative research

Interview at least 5 people who you identified as part of your core audience (see [guidelines above](#interview-guidelines)), then [blog](#blog) about what you found out.

### Blog

*Individually*: jot down the **5 key points** for each interview as early as possible, whilst they're all still fresh in your memory. 

Then *with your team*: write a **summary** of your interviews, in which you highlight **emerging patterns** (e.g. more than one interviewee pointing out the same issue).
