# Research review

<!-- 15 -->

What is **emerging** from your research (competitor analysis, interviews and online surveys) so far?

**Discuss** your key insights with your team for 5 minutes, then **tell** everyone else (1 minute per team).

# Personas

### What are user personas?

Personas are **fictional** characters based on **real data** from user research.

They allow you to visualise **users with common behavioural patterns** in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. 

By building personas you can better understand and talk about your **types** of users.

<!--

The example below is a design persona for a short-term loan company, created by [Ryan van der Merwe](http://www.elezea.com) 

He writes:

> The key to these types of personas are the **dimensions**, or in this particular case, the **loan drivers**. Note that for Monde, the monthly instalment is not important. What's important is that she gets the amount she needs to pay for her travel. For the persona that just wants a TV or some new shoes, this is different. For that persona the amount is less important â€” what's most important is whether or not they can afford the monthly instalment.

### Why do we need personas?

To set a **common understanding** of the user(s) we're designing for. 

When you work on a product, instead of talking about a generic *elastic user* you can talk about *Chris* or *Harry*.

<!-- The **vagueness** of *the user* causes many design failures, because *the user* is too *elastic*.  -->

#### Personas as a design tool

As a **design tool** personas are used to answer key questions that will inform design decisions: 

* What would *Ali* do in this situation?
* What would she need now? 
* Does *Taylor* understand this?

You'll see how team discussions will be much more focused when you use personas, rather than a vague *elastic user*.

In order to be a **useful** design tool personas should **challenge** your design decisions, not simply validate them.

#### What dimensions are used to group users into a persona? 

1. **Behaviours**, what users do
* **Attitudes**, what users expect 
* **Motivations**, what users want / need 
* **Limitations**, what blocks them from doing what they want / need

Choosing relevant dimensions is the trickiest part of creating useful personas (more on this in the example below). 

#### What dimensions should NOT be used to group users into a persona? 

1. Age
* Gender
* Education
* Location and other typical *demographics* (quantifiable characteristics of a given population, such as nationality, religion and ethnicity)

### Dos and Don'ts

In order to answer the above questions usefully and help you make effective design decisions, here are some dos and don'ts to keep in mind when building personas.

#### Real data <sup>DO

`+` Do base your personas on **real data**: people that you know or have interviewed / surveyed.

#### Extreme <sup>DO

`+` Do rather go for the **extreme cases**, and the middle will take care of itself. For example: design for children that can't read well yet, or for children that are not familiar with the internet, etc.

#### Needs and goals <sup>DO
 
`+` Do base your personas on **needs**, **goals**, and dimensions that have a direct impact on their interaction with the product you're designing.

#### Casuality <sup>DO

`+` Do focus on **causality**: what are the **reasons** your personas behave in a certain way? What **drives** them in their choices?

#### Fiction <sup>DON'T 

`-` Don't make your personas entirely **fictional**. Your product is going to be used by real people, not fairytale characters that unquestioningly adopt it and happily use it ever after.

#### Delusion <sup>DON'T

`-` Don't make your personas perfectly match the *ideal user* of the product you're designing. I call these **delusional personas**. 

Personas should challenge your design decisions, not simply mirror them.

#### In your own image <sup>DON'T

`-` Don't create user personas in your *own image*. It's easy (and tempting) to create personas who are in their early 20s, living in London and studying design or working in a creative agency in Shoreditch... but there's life beyond our **homophilic bubbles**.

#### Simplistic <sup>DON'T

`-` Don't **oversimplify** your personas: real people are complex, not shallow and generic.

#### Demographics <sup>DON'T
 
`-` Don't worry about demographic detail: just enough to help us get to know this persona. For example *Ben, 46, father of a girl and a primary school teacher*

## Your turn

<!-- 60 make, 30 discuss -->

With your team: create **three personas** that represent your target audience, using [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/).

Make sure you pick meaningful *dimensions* (not just the standard Xtensio template).

* `60 minutes` to **make** your personas
* `30 minutes` to **present** your work-in-progress to everyone else


# Content strategy

`30 minutes`

**Discuss** with your team the questions below and **write down** your notes in a GDoc (**share** it with everyone in Slack). 

- How do your personas represent your **target audience(s)**?   

	Just to make sure we haven't missed out the obvious bit.
	
- What **information** are your personas looking for? 

	Make a **list** of information people are looking for, in order of perceived importance (based on your research, ie interviews and surveys, and on your own experience).

- What **language** do your personas respond to?   

	In other words, how can you *dress* that information so that it's appealing to your audience? Write down some ideas or examples.


# Workshop

By now you should have an idea of **who** your target users are and **what** they want from the website you're designing.

The next steps in the process are:

- map your **content** 
- draft the **copy** of your site

We'll start both these steps today, but by no means they will be *finished* after the first attempt.

A solid design process is based on **iterations**: 

1. You come up with an **idea** (for content, for a layout, for a campaign etc.)
2. **Prototype** it 
3. **Test** it with a bunch of people
4. With the results from your test, go back to the *drawing board* and refine (or scrap) your idea. And **repeat**!

### Content map

`60 minutes`

Start mapping out your content on **post-its** and arrange them on a large sheet of **paper**.

Don't worry about *interfaces* and *layout* for now. 

As you map your content, you can think of clustering sets of post-its into *pages*.

### Copy

`60 minutes`

Create a GDoc (name it as `YOUR_TEAM - content strategy` where `YOUR_TEAM` is the name of your team) and share it with *everyone* on Slack (make sure `Anyone with the link` can at least `comment`).

With your [*personas*](#personas) and [*content map*](#content-map) in mind, **draft** the copy of your site.

Next week we'll **test** your first draft (read out loud) between us.

<!--**Edit** your draft: remove the bits that are not so important, and tweak the other bits to sound like what your audience(s) may want to read.-->


# Homework

### Copy-writing

Keep working on your website's [**copy**](#copy) with your team. Next week we'll **test** your first draft (read out loud) between us.

### Peer-learning research

Design **patterns** are a way to describe *solutions* to common *challenges*. 

<!--They explain *interaction models* and *layout structures* that make it easier for users to understand an interface and accomplish their goals.-->

[GoodUI](http://goodui.org) is an excellent resource for UI (**U**ser **I**nterface) patterns.

Each team will **research one pattern**. 

1. Explain **how** that pattern works and **why**. 
* Show a few **examples** of the pattern in action. Both *good and bad examples*.   
* To make your mini-lesson interactive and memorable, ask **questions** to the rest of the class. For instance, you can ask people:
	* if they agree/disagree with a statement
	* guess a fact/figure before you reveal the answer
 	* how they feel about an example you are showing them
