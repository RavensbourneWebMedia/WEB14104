- [ ] Questions: 
	- How do your personas represent your **target audience(s)**? Just to make sure we haven't missed out the obvious bit.
	- What ***information*** are your personas looking for? Let's make an `ol` of information your research indicates people are looking for (in order of perceived importance)
	- What **language** do they respond to? In other words, how can you *dress* that information so that it's appealing to your audience? Let's write down some recommendations
