# Peer-learning

Design **patterns** are a way to describe *solutions* to common *challenges*. 

[GoodUI](http://goodui.org) is an excellent resource for UI (**U**ser **I**nterface) patterns.

Each team will **research one pattern**. 

* Explain **how** that pattern works and **why**. 
* Show a few **examples** of the pattern in action. Both *good and bad examples*.   
* Explain how you could use that pattern for the Web Media site you're currently designing
* To make your mini-lesson interactive and memorable, ask **questions** to the rest of the class. For instance, you can ask people:
	* if they agree/disagree with a statement
	* guess a fact/figure before you reveal the answer
 	* how they feel about an example you are showing them
