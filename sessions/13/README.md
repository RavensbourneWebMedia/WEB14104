# Peer-learning

Design **patterns** are a way to describe *solutions* to common *challenges*. 

[GoodUI](http://goodui.org) is an excellent resource for UI (**U**ser **I**nterface) patterns.

Each team will **research one pattern**. 

* Explain **how** that pattern works and **why**. 
* Show a few **examples** of the pattern in action. Both *good and bad examples*.   
* Explain how you could use that pattern for the Web Media site you're currently designing
* To make your mini-lesson interactive and memorable, ask **questions** to the rest of the class. For instance, you can ask people:
	* if they agree/disagree with a statement
	* guess a fact/figure before you reveal the answer
 	* how they feel about an example you are showing them

# Content strategy

[Last week](../12) you started working on your website's [**copy**](../12#copy). 

Today we'll **test and edit** your first draft.

### Your turn

You'll be working with another team. 

Before you start, switch on the `Suggesting mode` in your GDoc.

1. Team A: choose one part (a couple of paragraphs) of your website *copy* and **read it out loud** to Team B.
* Team B: listen and answer these questions about what you just heard 

	* Who is this copy for?
	* When do users read this? What may they **feel** at that point?
	* What do users **need to know** (in the context of this element)? Is there any information missing? Is there too much information?
	* What must they do now, if anything? Is there a **call to action**? 
	* Are there any bits that **sound clunky** or don't flow?
	* **How else** could this copy be written?
* Team A: take notes about what may need tweaking, jot down comments and ideas.
* Swap roles. Team B read their chosen part to Team A, who listen and comment on it.
* Repeat this test for *at least three parts* of your copy.

Now **edit your draft**: remove the bits that are not so important, integrate those which are missing, and tweak the other bits to sound like what your audience(s) may want to read.
