`****`

Akvile and Ben

It's legit!

Stock images don't look authentic. Actual images take more time.

Bad reviews improve conversion by 67%

Exact numbers look more legit 

### [Loss aversion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xBWwGEgBYll2c_G_jPt3XnHHS6KfaXrrjjVUqgGsm0o/edit#slide=id.p)

Good questions!

Loss is twice as powerful as gain

`****`

Putting others' interests ahead of yours.

`YOU do deserve better` instead `I build the best websites`

Arguing against your self interest is a credibility booster (nice case study).

Good examples!

Body language a bit close, slides slightly crammed

Good examples though (Outlook, FB)

Press it and see what happens

Get to the point with fewer words.

* Use active voice
* Get read of meaningless words
* Get rid of repeated words
* Make sure it reads OK

Excellent: good vs bad examples on the same slide, progressively enhancing a sentence!
