Questions that could guide your blog post (in no particular order):

* Where do you think the *myth* you chose may come from? Eg: *why do some people believe that users don't scroll webpages?*
* Where did you hear about this *myth*? 
* If you feel like it isn't a *myth*, what are the reasons? 
* What are alternative ways to approach the design problem that the *myth* addresses?
