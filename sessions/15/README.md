# Formative presentations

You'll present your work-in-progress on [**Our space**](../../projects/our-space) to me and a couple of guests (no worries, they're friendly people and you may have seen them around Ravensbourne before ;)

### WTF should we present?

Prepare a pitch presentation:

* Who are your **competitors** and how do they communicate online? 
* Who is your **target audience**? You could start from your **research** (surveys and interviews) and then present your **personas**. 
* How are you going to communicate to your target audience? In other words, what is your **content strategy**? You can show examples of your **copy**, as well as presenting your **content map**.
* What are your inspirations? You can show your **moodboard**  of ideas.
* How are you structuring your content? You can present your **wireframes** at different stages, from paper sketches to digital wireframes, to the HTML + CSS **prototype**.
* What are your **next steps**?

The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects which you consider relevant.

### How long should our presentation be?

Roughly **15 minutes** per team, plus 5 minutes for feedback and questions.
