# Homework

Each team has a **project manager** (PM) for this week.

Team | PM
---- | ---
Hermanos | Mayur
Undefined | Callum

You have a **to-do list** (either on [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) or [Trello](https://trello.com/)) which we agreed on today.

**Keep working on it!**

Next Friday you'll report back to the whole class on your progress, then appoint a new PM.

### Branding guidelines 

Using the super-useful and free app [Frontify](https://frontify.com/), start putting together the branding guidelines for the Web Media site you're building. We'll review them next week.
