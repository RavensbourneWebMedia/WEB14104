Summative [presentations](#presentations) and [hand-in](#hand-in-checklist)

<!-- Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)! -->


# Presentations

We'll start at 10:00 and we aim to wrap up by 3pm-ish. 

In the morning you will present your work on [Sharing is caring](../../projects/sharing-is-caring), the cause you chose to advocate through a one-pager. In the afternoon you will pitch your proposal for the Web Media micro-site, aka [Our space](../../projects/our-space).

Which project? | Who? | How long?
-------------- | ---- | ---------
Sharing is caring | Individual | 5 minutes per person
Our space | Team | 15 minutes per team

### WTF should we present?

For each project, prepare a **pitch** presentation.

As a pitch, you want to focus on the **solution** your site provides to a **problem** for your target **users** (less on the process).

> Talk about them, not yourself.

#### Structure

The **structure** of your pitch is up to you. 

A **story** is an effective and proven way to structure your pitch. 

Humans have been telling stories for thousands of years, and our **brains** are wired to emotionally respond to stories more than to facts and figures. When someone tells you a story, the same areas of your brain and their brain get active. If they say "Danny kicked the ball..." your motor cortex, which coordinates your body movements, will fire up. That's how powerful stories are.

You can frame your pitch as a story in a couple of ways:

* Challenge > process > outcome (from a client point of view)

* Problem > solution > result (from a user point of view)

#### Slides

Your slides should help your audience focus on your key points. If you put too much text in your slides, you'll end up confusing people.

Tip: **one point per slide**.

> Avoid showing what you are saying and saying what you are showing.	

#### Delivery

When you stand up to present your project, remember that *everyone wants you to win*.

If you're a little nervous, take a few **deep breaths**. 

Throughout your presentation, get comfortable with **silence**. Everyone needs a bit of it to digest what you're saying.

> Silence is better than bullshit.


# Hand-in checklist

Create a `WEB14105-Name-Surname.md` MarkDown document (where `Name` is your own name and `Surname` is your own surname, like `WEB14105-Matteo-Menapace.md`).

> You can edit MarkDown documents with the [Mou app](http://25.io/mou/) on OSX, the [MarkdownPad app](http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows, or online with [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) (all free).

In that MarkDown document, add the following:
