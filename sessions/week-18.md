# Week 18

### Today, Friday 12th June 2015

Summative [presentations](#presentations) and [hand-in](#hand-in-checklist)



# Presentations

### Tips for the presenter

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

<!--
* Don't try to **please me**.   
  
	Our ideas may be different and I respect that. Your job is to show the value of your work, not to flatter me. 
-->

### Tips for everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button because it could be confused with an error message?`, which is much more effective, and also testable.




# Feedback spreadsheet

[This is the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nvqK4OPTnL_lTCv6MupNNaoENlJtWab3mYDfSJmWEc/edit?usp=sharing) where we all give each other feedback.




# Hand-in checklist

Your project [hand-in package](#hand-in-package) should include the following (from the [project components](../README.md#components) list):

1. **Research** [*analysis*](week-02.md#blog) of bad websites and [*mood board*](week-04.md#homework)
* **Interface design** experimentation and testing of ideas through *wireframes* at various stages, from [paper](week-05.md#sketch-out-your-ideas-on-paper) to [digital](week-06.md#redraft-your-wireframes)
* **Front-end code** responsive, cohesive and appropriately structured [*HTML & CSS*](week-11.md#homework) (bonus: JavaScript); includes [recipe mini-project](week-05.md#blog)
* **Back-end code** accessible and dynamic web-pages served via [*WordPress*](week-14.md#template) (bonus: plugins) 
* **Workflow** all your project files on *GitHub* (bonus: action plan)

### Project files on GitHub

Make sure your files and folders are named sensibly. 

That is, no `Hand in` or `Archive` or `Project` or any other similarly anonymous and/or generic names. Good examples: `Competitor Analysis`, `Wireframes` and `home-logged-in.jpg`

See file size restrictions [below](#file-size-restrictions-on-GitHub).

If you haven't done it yet (which is bad really, as you should have been using GitHub to back up your project work since the beginning of this unit).. [**fork** the official unit repository](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Web-development-workshop#fork-destination-box).

[![](assets/github-fork.png)](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Web-development-workshop#fork-destination-box)

Clone **your fork** into your computer. See a [how-to-git guide here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Guides/blob/master/how-to-git.md).

*Push* your project work to GitHub in the `students/YOUR_NAME` folder of **your fork**. 

#### File size restrictions on GitHub

GitHub doesn't allow you to store files larger than **50MB**. 

You can store those on Google Drive or Dropbox (or any other bulk-storage service). 

Any large file that you consider important for us to review when marking your projects (for example, your user-testing videos) must be accessible on the Web. Include a link to it in your [hand-in package](#hand-in-package).

### Presentations

Include your formative and summative presentations in your [hand-in package](#hand-in-package).

Export them as `.pdf`. No `.ppt` or `.key` please.

If you have made a *presentation video*, upload it to YouTube (or similar) and include the link in your [hand-in package](#hand-in-package).

### Hand-in package

1. Create a new folder and name it like so: `COURSECODE-Name-Surname`, for example `WEB12345-Danny-Base`.  
	
	<!---->
* In the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` folder add a **`README.md`** file and list all the links to your project work
	* links to your work on **your** GitHub repository :octocat:
	* links to Dropbox / Google Drive bulk files (for videos from user-testing, presentations..)
	* website link(s) (eg, your site on `raveweb.net` or elsewhere)
	* links to your blog posts
	* .. any other links that you consider relevant and can improve your grade :+1:

	Don't add anything else to your `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` folder, only your `README.md`.  
  
	See an example of a good `README.md` [here](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/README.md).

	<!---->
* Create a **zip archive** for your `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` folder. It should keep the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention, for example `WEB12345-Jess-Scripts.zip`	  

	<!---->
* Upload your `COURSECODE-Name-Surname.zip` to *Moodle* by 23:59 on Friday 12th of June 2015.
