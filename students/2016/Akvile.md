## Sharing is Caring - [Summative Presentation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8or16CjlFbQ) ##

For my Sharing is Caring project I was told to choose a cause that I care about and create a website choosing an audience and explaining why the cause is important. For my cause, I chose to talk about endangered species and why it is important to protect them, and I chose to talk about a Giant Panda named Bao Bao on my website. I chose her because my main website audience are children as I hope to raise awareness for young people to understand the cause and hopefully it will inspire them to help to protect these animals in the future.

### Sketches, Concepts & Storyboard ###
Here are some sketches and ideas I made for my website designs. I was not too sure yet at this point so there are only a few.

[Sketch 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4fyUw-xogHuZzgtM3RJYkZNT1dILWNRQXBucXljRmN4Z3pN), [Sketch 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4fyUw-xogHubHBiMVpGQlkycVBoZDBBdnZuSGxDajUtcXRR), [Sketch 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4fyUw-xogHuN19hbTZINmd6dzZlZWlFWWF1N3d3OUZFRUI0)

### [Wireframe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4fyUw-xogHuNDhyX2N5Y18wclE "Wireframe") ###
I created a wireframe to show what my final website will look like once it is completed. The wireframe consists of the basic concept and structure of what everything will be, where it will be places and how it will look/work.

### [Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bliHTMwICG1v4vuMZhFFmECaltjYmpzrAI6OvmKAgzU/edit?usp=sharing "Research Document") ###
The research documents has all of the websites and sources I used to find my secondary research for my project. It explains which parts of the research I found I used and why I though it will be good to add those parts into the website.

### [Content Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFv0pob9xrK8DSKdZRN3L6HVG8MKx2uhQYA9piQkaOU/edit?usp=sharing "Content Strategy") ###
My content strategy for the project consists of my target audiences, explaining in short why they would care about the website, their motivations, fears, etc. It also contains the text format structure of where the text will be placed on the page and what the text will say.

### [Formative Video Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5U2TFkXb4I "Formative Video") ###

## Our Space ##

For the Our Space project, I was in a team with 3 other people and our task was to create a new website for the Web Media Productions course. It was our task to find information using interviews and research to know exactly what people are looking for when they would be using this website and our job was to make it happen.

### [Interviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSArZv00ZSLT81GDDOT3Bvov8rIhhREhMNeJVIv9euA/edit?usp=sharing "Interviews") + [Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/ljuokOsbecBwpzHL2 "Survey") ###
The document includes the questions we had made to ask people about what we should be adding into the website. These questions had the people answer simple questions related to the university and the course. We had also created a survey on Google to allow other people to submit their answers through a given link.

### [Competitor Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f1gxio5eoPP6AVW4gTaTdN2om8oj5v-UxDotZydRexw/edit?usp=sharing "Competitor Analysis") ###

The competitor analysis includes information I collected from looking at two other course pages on other university websites and checking what has been done well, bad and what could need improvements while at the same time checking what we will need to include in our own website.

### Personas - [Mike](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4fyUw-xogHuTGZRMmZNX09RSXc/view?usp=sharing "Mike Persona"), [Brenda](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4fyUw-xogHuY0hteDZMLV9wWDA/view?usp=sharing "Brenda Persona"), [Clint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4fyUw-xogHuWmUtMVF3STdSYWc/view?usp=sharing "Clint Persona") ###

The personas we had created for our website were to be related to our target audience. We created 3 different people based on similar traits and wants from actual people who are interested in this course. These personas help us to see what kind of information these people would want to see on the website to answer their questions, worries, fears, motivations, etc.

### [Content Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-WTmhlciDwIOUFlMW90UGp5c0E/view?usp=sharing "Content Map") ###

The content map that we created contains sticky notes showing the structure and ideas of how we would want our website to be linked and what parts of the information go where on the pages.

### [Content Strategy](https://docs.google.com/a/students.rave.ac.uk/document/d/1yFxnkLyAGoLW35LlD9CPzGeUCsgQxk1PzBCTidBwrdk/edit?usp=sharing "Content Strategy") ###

Our content strategy includes the target audience information and the text and notes about what text will go on which pages and where it will be placed.

### Typesetting Experiments ###

TypeCast Links: [Style 1](http://typecast.com/mdQvbt2xNQ/share/48eb2da7b744f56d908d3f824f1a9c2ddb3cbb89Rk3c "Style 1"), [Style 2](http://typecast.com/mdQvbt2xNQ/share/e6dcb5b26b50b7dee3b4d29efebe7b38f24ec093V "Style 2"), [Style 3](http://typecast.com/mdQvbt2xNQ/share/5333b5fa6eb6f9de4e06162c807c7019ea5a618dtr "Style 3"), [Style 4](http://typecast.com/mdQvbt2xNQ/share/b070183672035a4a49a82b5ad3b7ffe871050134Vz--T "Style 4"), [Style 5](http://typecast.com/mdQvbt2xNQ/share/f502a108b34640a6a5d462e33490670687d40578gZJkD4b "Style 5")

Using TypeCast I created 5 different font styles just to test and see what kind of style we could potentially use for our website and what font would suit the website to make it look appropriate for the audience.

### [Wireframes](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3GR6CwtALpAWVVmMThYZU16WFk&usp=sharing "Wireframes") ###

Here are the wireframes that we made for our website, which were the ideas of what the pages could visually look like and what information we would put on those pages.

### [Moodboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4fyUw-xogHuRXlwMW56Wno5SW8/view?usp=sharing "Moodboard") ###

This is the moodboard I created with some design ideas I found. I wanted to find interesting, yet clean designs that would potentially show a quick and easy way to display small bits of information and type of design we should use to show it. I wanted to look at designs which were modern, but did not seem too childish or formal.

### [Formative Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d6sZTTvwlTNRQD2GZLESAHoUA7wkSgpPhnqgqlEXofE/edit?usp=sharing "Formative Presentation") ###

This is our formative presentation explaining and showing different parts of our website and our working journey.
