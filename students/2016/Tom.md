### Sharing-is-caring

##### One page, interactive, website


For this project we had to chose a charity, cause, or problem and create a compelling one page website that provided or moved towards an ideal solution. I chose UK-Flooding. This is not a cause that has directly effected me, however it is one of the detrimental side effects of Global Warming. Therefore, I felt that talking about solving one of the causes of Global Warming would have a bigger impact, than doing a website on how we can all 'STOP' global warming.
