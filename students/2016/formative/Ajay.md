This document will give you an insight of my project that I am currently working on. The topic for this term is called Sharing is Caring, where we have to create a content filled site using code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Creatively communicating and raising awareness of a cause that I care about. 

Below is a link of a video presentation explaining what I have done so far for this project.
