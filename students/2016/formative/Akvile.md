## Sharing is Caring ##
*Formative Hand-In*

### Video Presentation ###
Below is the link to my 3 minute video presentation for my project website. In the video I explain on the project, what cause I have chosen and how I designed the website based on the text I had to use to make it effective for my target audience.

### Content Strategy ###
My content strategy documents the information about my target audiences I would be looking at and the content structure of how the text on my website is going to be laid out and where each part of text will be played to ensure the website flows and the audience is not lost from the message.

### Research Documents ###
My research documents have images, text and website pages that all relate to my chosen cause as I had researched it. I tried to stick to mostly charities and organisations that work to help wildlife, rather than just obtain information about what it is. I wanted to get more of a personal idea of this cause and to see how many people actually care and try to help to improve this issue.

### Website on GitHub Pages ###
Below is the link to the website which I created and uploaded to GitHub. In the folder I included all of the files for this website. This includes the main index.html file and all the folders containing all of the CSS files, images and JavaScript files.
