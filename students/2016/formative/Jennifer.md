-  When starting this project, I had a number of different causes that i could have chosen but none that resonated with me like this one. Throughout this unit, I’ve decided to go along the path more so of talking about an unspoken topic rather than a cause. Its border line between gender equality and cultural traditions. My site hopefully will communicate to my targeted audience about the influence traditional values and gender equality play on the way their children will perceive themselves. This also isn’t made any better by the culture shock and the longing to please your parents and honouring their parental virtues. 
-  My targeted audience is parents, more so parents of children with who have emigrated. This is a topic,  I align with completely so feel like i have more of an insight into. The children I’m sub targeting are around the ages of 15 to 19 so this in turn will affect the language that i use on the campaign for. 
-  Overall the site is just to create awareness of the topic and to possibly instill that into peoples subconscious.
