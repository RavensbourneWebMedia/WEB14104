This is the link to my video presentation for this project. In this video I discuss what I plan to include on my site, who my site is aimed towards and how I will create my content to attract these audiences.

This document includes five other sites and campaigns that also cover the issue of gender inequality. I chose the ones that all had something that I could on my own site. I included links and screen prints to these sites.
