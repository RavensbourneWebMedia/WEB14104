##Introduction
Sharing is caring is the individual project about using code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) creatively comminucate and advocate a cause you care about.

I chose to advocate the Great Ormond Street Hospital charity, which raises funds for the Great Ormond Street hospital, dedicated to treating sick children. I know many people who have been treated there as children and babies and parents whose children who owe their lives to the doctors and nurses that work there.

Author and playwright, J.M. Barrie left the rights to his novel and play, *Peter Pan* to the hospital on the event of his death. This means that any time the play is performed in the UK, Spain or the USA, GOSH gets royalties from the profits (the copyright has expired elsewhere and is considered to be in the public domain). The Hospital signed a deal with the Walt Disney Corporation to grant the latter exclusive animation rights to *Peter Pan*. I felt as though this connection to the hospital gave me an creative way in to getting an emotional response from my audience.

##Formative presentation
I created a formative presentation outlining the work I have completed towards this unit so far. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iHZtw_WwOd8CiSLxLJ1C6uAFWe6EfM-s5F8u7VftcWY/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the Google Slides presentation, and [here](https://youtu.be/rWRpxbXLQFM) is a link to the video presentation.

##Content Strategy
I used a content strategy document to plan out who my audience(s) are and how best to target them. I then used the same document to plan out my copy incorporating what I knew about my audiences from my research and what I knew about my cause and it's connection to *Peter Pan*. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/130U80HfUgvpVeNw_tG5AvgxEE9sYiGfk9_ZzgJ5gqic/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the document.

##Research
I completed both primary and secondary research into my cause and my target audiences, to ensure I would be able to reach my audiences as effectively as possible and I knew my cause inside out. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YEyqOUUxSaGqA8pNi692CIc0oQUX-KL9La8CE7Rce4/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the Google Doc with all of my research.

##Github links
After I had written my copy and planned out the structure of my one-page website, I started to translate it into code. I then published the code on GitHub, which you can see [here](http://rosiebuddell.github.io/Sharing-is-caring/). And [here] (https://github.com/Rosiebuddell/Sharing-is-caring.git) is a link to my GitHub repository.
